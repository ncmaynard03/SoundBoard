1.		Bobby recorded an audio clip of his friend, Jesus. He wants to add the clip to the soundboard application so sometime
later he can play it back to his friend. Bobby launches the application and imports the sound by clicking "import sound". 
A window opens and asks for the sounds name in the application. The menu also gives the option to add tags to the
sound file. Bobby wants to categorize future sounds of his friend Jesus, so he clicks the "Create New Tag" button and writes
'#Jesus' as the tag name and then clicks the 'Create' button. Now Bobby clicks "Add Tag" and selects '#Jesus'. Then Bobby
clicks the 'Finish' button to finish importing the sound.


2.		User doesn't like the position of the soundboard over their fullscreen game of Apex Legends. It would be blocking the
map when playing a match. User minimizes the game and switches over to the Soundboard Application. User then clicks the "File" tab in the top left 
of the application. Then, they select the "Customize" submenu item and then choose from a list of customization options
available to them. They want to move the drawn-over Soundboard window slightly to the right of the map, so the user
needs to select "Location" then "Advanced", which opens two text boxes labeled "x:" and "y:" with values 20, 20 (20 
pixels from left, 20 pixels from top). To move the drawn-over window, the user changes the x value from 20 to 150.
Now the in-game window should have shifted to the right by 130 pixels.


3.		User doesn't like the drawn-over window being transparent. User opens "File" tab then selects the submenu
item "Customize". From there, they select the option "Opacity". Upon clicking, a popup slider with the current value on
the right appears. They adjust the value to be 100 and close the popup.  


4.		Tabetha wants to delete one of her sounds from the application. She types the name of the sound into the search
bar to locate it. She clicks the sounds "Edit" button. A small menu showing the options "Change name", "Add tag",
and "Remove" appear. She selects "Remove" and then the sound disappears from her application.


5.		Will wants to blast a loud sound through his speakers. Will types the tag '#horn' and finds one his favorite sounds:
"Sumburgh Foghorn". Before pressing play, he adjusts the volume to be at the maximum volume using the volume slider.
Then Will presses play at which the person right next to Will's subwoofer nearly falls out of the chair. As the audio clip
progressed, the slider bar, representing the length of the clip in seconds and minutes, moved from right to left.


6.		User doesn't like the default keybinds setup by the developers of the application. They prefer to use their number
pad for media controls. User navigates to the "Customize" menu item and selects "Keybinding", which opens a menu
showing all current keybinds for the application. Each keybind value is on a button, so when the user clicks on the button
for pausing the clip, a popup window opens asking the user to press whatever button they want on their keyboard to
assign the new key to the pause button. After changing several other key bindings, they click "Ok" to close the "Keybinding"
window.


7.		User has a child in the room with them and they want to get a laugh out of the kid, but they don't want to play any
explicit sounds. They navigate to the ListBox containing "Filter" by default. They select "Filter Out" then type "#explicit"
into the TextBox next to the ListBox. Only sounds without the tag #explicit are now shown.


8.		User wants to stop the Soundboard application from drawing over their other windows. Luckily there is a keybind
for that, so all they need to do is hit the keybind which works like a toggle.


9.		Brian doesn't really take interest in the default color scheme of the application. He decides to change it, so he
navigates to the "Schemes" menu item by clicking "File", then "Customization". After looking through many schemes
provided by the developers, Brian selects "Retro" to give the application an older look. Now Brian is enjoying his 
soundboard in style.


10. user realized they forgot to rename a sound file when they imported it so they do not know what the sound is. they 
can play the sound to determine what it is, right click and press "rename" to give jt a new name. then the user can right
click and press "add tags" to organize the file better.
